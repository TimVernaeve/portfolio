      "description": "Buurtplanr was our thesis project, which aimed to allow local townships to invite their citizens to co-create the urban planning of their towns. This was achieved through an online platform where citizens could create their own vision of what the project should look like using a 3D builder. I was responsible for the business, design, and technical setup as well as the follow-up of the project. This included creating the repository, setting up Storybook, Style Dictionary, PostCSS, ESLint, and TypeScript configuration. \n I also encouraged that the rest of the team followed the predefined standards to make the code maintainable and readable for all team members. Additionally I also assisted in creating more complicated components when my team struggled since I had more experience with react and typescript. Our tech stack was: Next.js, Three.js and Node.js (Express.js).",

We accomplished this using Vue.js, Three.js, and Node.js (Express.js). I was responsible for developing the back-end and the admin pannel.
